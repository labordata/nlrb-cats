# Case files and code for NLRB union representation elections, 1999-2010

This repository [has copies of publicly available files](./raw) from the National Labor Relations Board Case Activity Tracking System, holding closed-case records from the NLRB's various case-tracking databases. The repository also contains code to turn those files into a [sqlite database](https://labordata.github.io/nlrb-cats/nlrb.sqlite.zip).

To build the database yourself run the Makefile:

```bash
> make
```
